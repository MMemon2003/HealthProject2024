## Eagle 
## is a electronic design automation(EDA) that lets to make the Printed Circuit Board(PCB) that connects schematic diagrams,PCB routing and comprehensive library content. 

## Schematic file 
The software used to make the Schamtic and the Board, in other other terms, the software used to make the PCB is Eagle.

## Connections of the SEN0203 and LCD 
These two connections of the SEN0203 and LCD were not available on SnapEDA, so used 3 and 4 connectors in the Schematic. 
The connectors used in the schematic for the SEN0203 and the LCD is called the AMD connectors.
