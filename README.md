## Overall Design
The overall design of my project is a health gadget called the GP Virtual Health System connected to a microcontroller called ESP8266 with a remotely service to individuals, particularly who cannot travel to allow users to monitor their health from the comfort of their homes and enages in virtual meetings with their GP or Doctor. The microcontroller ensures accurate collection of patient information and provides precise health status updates. It opearates with 2.4GHz Wifi which supports WPA/WPA2 and Bluetooth does not support the ESP8266 so HC05 Bluetooth module will operate the Bluetooth with NodeMCU.
## Hardware used in this project 
The hardware used in this project are microcontrollers such as ESP8266 also known as NodeMCU, Sensors used with Wifi in this project such as SEN0203 Heart rate sensor, DS18B20 Temperature Sensor, and sensors used with bluetooth in this project such as SBM70 Bluetooth Blood Pressure monitor, to allow the Bluetooth Blood pressure monitor, I will be using a bluetooth module called the HC05 Bluetooth module which will allow to connnect with the ESP8266 and the SBM70 Blood Pressure Monitor. The PCB is ordered using Eagle. The DS18B20 Temperature sensor and SEN0203 Heart rate sensor operates with the NodeMCU on the breadbaord successfully and Tasmota. 
## Software
The software used in this project are Software are Node RED,SQL Database,Tasmota,PHP Servers,HTML, CSS and Java coded Websites, IP address to access websites,Microsoft Azure. Tasmota is ready with all Heart rate and Temperature sensor.

## Database
The databases that i will be using is the SQL server. This database allows users and GP or Doctors to search previous or current data heallth information for the patient. It will be sending data from NodeRED and HTML Websites. 

## Security
The security around this project, The HTML Websites will be secured by a login of the registered Patients and Doctor's ID databases, so if the patient or doctor is regsitered, it will go to the next page otherwise show a error.
